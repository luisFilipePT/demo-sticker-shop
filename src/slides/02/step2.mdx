Our "Hello World" is up and running, great ðŸŽ‰

Let's create a Github repository to hold our recently created project.

## Using Hub

_I will be using [hub](https://hub.github.com/) which in my configuration is aliased to `git` extending this cli tool with some cool features.   
`Hub` is an extension to command-line git_  

<br />

In the root of the project run (creates a repo with the folder name on Github)
```shell
git create
```

Create the initial commit adding all files and setting a commit message
```shell
git commit -am "Initial commit"
```

Push all your code to the Github server
```shell
git push origin master
```

## Using GitHub cli

In the root of the project run (creates a remote repo)
```shell
gh repo create [repo-name]
```

Push all your code to the Github server
```shell
git push origin master
```

NOTE: if you have problems with authentication, you need to create a `Personal Token` on your GitHub account and use it as the password for the CLI ðŸ™‚


## Using traditional approach

Go to your Github web page and create a repository: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

Copy the url for the repository.

Then add the remote origin
```shell
git remote add origin [repo_url]
```

Push all your code to the Github server
```shell
git push origin master
```

## Result

If you now head to your Github project page you should see the default Gatsby `README`
