Our "Hello World" is up and running, great

Let's create a Github repository to hold our recently created project

_I will be using [hub](https://hub.github.com/) which in my configuration is aliased to `git` extending this one with some cool features.   
`Hub` is an extension to command-line git_  

<br />

If you prefer you can switch the next step by one of the alternatives below:
* Create a repo on the Github interface [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo)
* Using the brand new [github cli](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create)


In the root of the project run (creates a repo with the folder name on Github)
```shell
git create
```

Create the initial commit adding all files and setting a commit message
```shell
git commit -am "Initial commit"
```

Push all your code to the Github server
```shell
git push origin master
```

If you now head to your Github project page you should see the defaul Gatsby `README`
