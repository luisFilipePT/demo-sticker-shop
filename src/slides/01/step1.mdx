Install the [gatsby-cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/) if you dont have it yet

```shell
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

Navigate to the directory where you want to create the project and

```shell
gatsby new sticker-shop
```

Move into the created directory

```shell
cd sticker-shop
```

Start the development server

```shell
gatsby develop
```

If all the steps where correct you should see a screen like this at `http://localhost:8000`
