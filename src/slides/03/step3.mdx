Now we have our project running locally and hosted on GitHub

Let's publish it and have it live on the internet

I will be using [netlify-cli](https://github.com/netlify/cli) which is the process that feels simpler to me but there is an alternative using the Netlify web interface.
<br />

If you don't have it already install the `netlify-cli`
```shell
npm install -g netlify-cli
```
