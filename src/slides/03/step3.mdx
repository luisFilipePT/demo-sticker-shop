Now we have our project running locally and hosted on GitHub

Let's publish it and have it live on the internet

I will be using [netlify-cli](https://github.com/netlify/cli) which is process that feels simpler to me but there is an alternative using the Netlify Interface 
<br />

If you don't have it already install the `netlify-cli`
```shell
npm install netlify-cli -g
```
