## Purpose of this project

This project was initially created to serve as a base for the two upcoming talks at `Undefined.js` in Leiria, Portugal on the 27th of March 2020 at 6pm at `xgeeks` new office.
<br/><br/>

## The Talks üëê

### Make the Web Simple again

#### Levering web development on top of the JAM stack.<br/>We will look at how ‚Äústatic sites‚Äù are everything but ‚Äústatic‚Äù today.<br/>Developing pipelines, back offices, payments, etc‚Ä¶ Do we even remember why we started?
_By Luis Filipe_

### What if the JAMStack is exactly what you need?

#### Focus on creating your product and making it unique without worrying about recurring topics like user management, persistence, shopping carts by using Gatsby themes.
_By David Alecrim_

After some initial feedback we decided to use it also as a step by step tutorial on how to create an online e-commerce application including theming and authentication.
We will add the steps as we go.
