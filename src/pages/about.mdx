## Purpose of this project

This project was initially created to serve as a base of the two upcoming talks at `undefined.js` in Leiria Portugal on the 29 of April 2020 at 18h00m at `xgeeks` office.

### Make the Web Simple again

#### Levering web development on top of the JAM stack.<br/>We will look at how “static sites” are everything but “static” today.<br/>Developing pipelines, back offices, payments, etc… Do we even remember why we started?
_By Luis Filipe_

### What if the JAMStack is exactly what you need?

#### Focus on creating your product and making it unique without worrying about recurring topics like user management, persistence, shopping carts by using Gatsby themes.
_By David Alecrim_   

After some initial feedback we decided to use it also as a step by step tutorial on how to create an online ecommerce application including theming and authentication.   
We will add the steps as we go.
